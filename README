Zonemaster
==========

Zonemaster is a cooperative project between .SE and AFNIC. It is a successor to both .SE's DNSCheck and AFNIC's Zonecheck.

The Perl modules included in this distribution comprise the "engine" part of the whole Zonemaster system. It is the framework needed to run tests, and the core set of implemented tests. User interfaces are distributed separately (or specially written), as may additional test modules be.

As of this writing, this code is in roughly alpha test state. It is fully usable, but not all the included tests have been verified to be correct. If you're interested in using this code, you should keep an eye on our Github repository (https://github.com/dotse/zonemaster).


Installation
============

The Zonemaster engine is installed just like any other Perl module:

perl Makefile.pl
make
make test
make install


Prerequisites
=============

The other modules needed to run the Zonemaster engine are listed in Makefile.PL as usual. One of them is Moose, so if you don't already have that installed a large number of modules will get installed.

For sending, receiving and interpreting DNS queries, the Zonemaster engine relies on the Net::LDNS module (available from CPAN). That module in turn relies on the ldns C library from NLNet Labs (https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/ldns/), so that needs to be installed first.


Documentation
=============

The documentation is at the moment a work in progress. If you want to use the engine, read the POD documentation for the Zonemaster module. If you want to see the test specifications and such, look at the Github repository.


License
=======

The software is released under the 2-clause BSD license. See separate LICENSE file.
