=head1 NAME

Zonemaster::Logger::Entry - module for single log entries

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    Zonemaster->logger->add( TAG => { some => 'arguments' });

There should never be a need to create a log entry object in isolation. They should always be associated with and created via a logger object.

=head1 CLASS METHOD

=over

=item levels

Returns a hash where the keys are log levels as strings and the corresponding values their numeric value.

=back

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item module

An auto-generated identifier of the module that created the log entry. If it was generated from a module under Zonemaster::Test, it will be an
uppercased version of the part of the name after "Zonemaster::Test". For example, "Zonemaster::Test::Basic" gets the module identifier "BASIC". If the
entry was generated from anywhere else, it will get the module identifier "SYSTEM".

=item tag

The tag that was set when the entry was created.

=item args

The argument hash reference that was provided when the entry was created.

=item timestamp

The time after the current program started running when this entry was created. This is a floating-point value with the precision provided by
L<Time::HiRes>. 

=item trace

A partial stack trace for the call that created the entry. Used to create the module tag. Almost certainly not useful for anything else.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item string

Simple method to generate a string representation of the log entry. Overloaded to the stringification operator.

=item numeric_level

Returns the log level of the entry in numeric form.

=back

=head1 CLASS METHOD

=over

=item start_time_now()

Set the logger's start time to the current time.

=back

=cut
